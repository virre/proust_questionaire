# Proust questionaire markdown generator

### What is this?
A Node.js express thing that asks you Proust qustionaire questions and then auto-generates questions as markdown. 

### Why is this? 
Uh, I was watching Deserbus For Hope 2023 (https://desertbus.org) and Proust Questionaires came up. So I was thinking that it might be fun to post to Discord, and Discord supports markdown so lets generate it as such. 

### Why Node.js/express? 
Because I never done anything in it before. This is more or less just me learning some express and node.js to widen my skill, and to clear my head from the Drupal I get paid to write during the daytime.

### Why published on Github? 
More or less as a why not (also to ease deployment)
